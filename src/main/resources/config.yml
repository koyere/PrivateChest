#            PrivateChest Configuration File         #
# -------------------------------------------------- #
#
# Welcome to the PrivateChest configuration!
# Here you can customize how the plugin behaves on your server.
# Use standard Bukkit color codes (&) for messages.
#

# --- Storage Settings ---

# Choose the storage system for chest data.
# Options: 'yaml' (default) or 'sqlite'
#
# YAML: Simple file-based storage, good for small to medium servers.
# SQLite: Database storage, better performance for large servers with many locked chests.
#
# Note: You can migrate between storage types using the /privatechest migrate command.
# Default: yaml
storage-type: yaml

# --- Message Prefix Settings ---

# Should the plugin add a prefix before its messages?
# Default: true
use-prefix: true

# The prefix to display before messages (only if 'use-prefix' is true).
# Default: "&7[&6PrivateChest&7] "
prefix: "&7[&6PrivateChest&7] "

# --- Feature Settings ---

# Enable sign-based protection. Players can lock chests by placing
# a sign with [Private] on the first line near the chest.
# Default: true
enable-sign-protection: true

# Enable chest locking limits based on player permissions.
# When enabled, players will have a maximum number of chests they can lock.
# Default: false
enable-chest-limits: false

# Default number of chests a player can lock if they don't have specific permissions.
# Only used when enable-chest-limits is true.
# Default: 5
default-chest-limit: 5

# --- Notification Settings ---

# Should the owner receive a small notification message when they
# successfully open one of their own locked containers?
# Default: true
notify-owner-on-open: true

# Should an admin receive a small notification message when they
# open a container using their bypass permission (privatechest.admin)?
# Default: true
notify-admin-on-open: true

# Should a trusted player receive a small notification message when they
# open a container they have been given access to?
# Default: true
notify-trusted-on-open: true

# --- Notes on Removed Options ---
#
# - allow-double-chests: Removed as double chest support is now core.
# - unlock-duration-seconds: Removed as temporary unlock is not currently implemented.
# - allow-shared-access: Removed as shared access (non-owner unlock with password)
#   is not currently implemented.
#
# If these features are added in the future, their options can be restored.
